How to deploy coookit project
==================
**coookit** is an engineering blog and a Documentation center for personal use only.
This is a partial copy of my private repo.

Build images locally
==============
To create a local DEV environment, run the command:
``sudo ./build.sh``
It will destroy already existing images.
Connect to the running containers
==============
``./connect.sh  [app|db]``
